The inputs required for population tracking are as follows:

**1. Number of occupied states(HOMO & below):** 

**2. Number of unoccupied states(LUMO & below):**

For plotting the change in population as a function of simulation time, two options are present as follows:

**3. All States:** For plotting the change in population for all available occupied and unoccupied states.

**4. Select the states:** Takes the input from **5 & 6** and plots the change in MO population accordingly.

**5. Number of occupied states(HOMO & below):** Input the number of occupied states to plot MO population change.

**6. Number of unoccupied states(LUMO & below):** Input the number of unoccupied states to plot MO population change.
