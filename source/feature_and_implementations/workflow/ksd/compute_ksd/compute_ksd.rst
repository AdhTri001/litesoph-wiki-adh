To perform Kohn Sham Decomposition (KSD), the following parameters are used:   

**1. List of frequencies (eV):** Input excitation energies (eV) to be targeted. For each frequency 
the KSD is performed and plotted seperately.

**2. Axis limit:** Higher limit of both X-axis (occupied energy) and 
Y-axis (unoccupied energy) for plotting. The origin is set as (0,0).
