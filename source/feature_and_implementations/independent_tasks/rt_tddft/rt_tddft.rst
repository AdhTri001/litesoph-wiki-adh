RT-TDDFT
==========
The RT-TDDFT calculations can be performed starting with external perturbations, such as, Delta pulse and laser pulse. For the input parameters
of delta pulse, see :ref:`delta-kick`. For the input parameters of laser pulse, see :ref:`laser-design-tools`.

.. _delta-kick:

Delta kick Inputs
#################

   :alt: delta_kick

**1. Laser Strength in a.u (E0):** Strength of the delta kick electric field to be applied. This excites all the electronic degrees of freedom at 
the beginning.

**2. Time steps (in attosecond):** Time steps for the dynamics of the Kohn-Sham equations.

**3. Number of Steps:** Total number of steps to be run for the dynamics. Total time is (Number of Steps*time steps)

**4. Frequency of data collection:** Number of times the data will be printed. Vale `1` indicates that data will be collected at each time steps. 

**5. Polarisation Direction:** Polarization of the applied external electric field.

Laser design
------------

**1. Type of Laser:** Available options are Gaussian pulse and Delta pulse. 

**2. Laser Tag:** Applicable only in the case of Pump-Probe analysis. Choose either pump or probe for laser design.

For the parameters of Delta kick, refer to :ref:`delta-kick`. 

For the parameters of Gaussian pulse, see below.

   **1. Time Origin in as:** Laser delay time from initialization of simulation in atto-seconds.

   **2. Relative strength at time origin, 10e-:** Relative Electric field strength at the starting time of the laser.

   **3. Peak Strength in au:** Intensity of laser in au.

   **4. Full Width Half Max (FWHM in eV):** FWHM of the Gaussian pulse.

   **5. Frequency (in eV):** Frequency of the Gaussian pulse.

   **6. Polarization Direction:** Direction of the applied laser.

**Add** and **Save** the lasers and view the laser using **Plot**.

Select the added lasers for which masking is to be applied. Under masking, check the **Masked Electric Field**. Use the following input parameters
for masking.

**1. Mask Type:** 
   Types of mask used as boundary to separated the masked and illuminated regions. Available options are :**plane** and **sphere**.
   
   **Plane**: refers to the use of a dividing plane to define the mask. 
   
   **Sphere**: refers to the use of a spherical region to illuminate

**2. Boundary Type:** Smearing type at the mask boundary. Available options are **abrupt** and **smooth**.

**Mask Specific Parameters**

**3. Axis:** 
Applicable for Mask Type: **Plane**. Direction along which the boundary is placed.

**4. Origin:** 
      * Applicable for Mask Type: **Plane**. The location of the dividing plane (in cell parameter units). Only for coordinate < origin, the region is illuminated.
      * Applicable for Mask Type: **Sphere**. Coordinates (in cell parameter units) of the centre of the Sphere used

**5. Radius:** Applicable for Mask Type: Sphere. Radius (in Angstroms) of the spherical region to be illuminated

.. **4. Origin:** Cut-off distance in fractional units beyond which the part of the system will be masked.

**Save** the masking details after including the above parameters.
